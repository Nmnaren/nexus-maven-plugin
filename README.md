# Sonatype Nexus OSS Maven Plugin (nexus-maven-plugin)

## Overview

This Apache Maven plugin is for moving artifacts from a origin repository 
to a target repository. The repositories can be on the same or different servers.

### Why?

Why we should do things like this? 
Maven's "SNAPSHOT-RELEASE" cycle doesn't support artifact handling needed in a 
Continuous Delivery environment (build always releases). In a CD environment, we
don't work with SNAPSHOT versions because we build always release candidates.
And during the CD Build Pipeline, we propagate artifacts through the stages.
"Enterprise Repository Servers" like Artifactory pro or Nexus Professional are 
supporting this by providing "staging repositories". This is not the
case in the Nexus OSS version and due to this we need a workaround.

## How it works

It's really simple and build on three steps:

- download the artifact from the origin repository using the maven-dependency-plugin
- upload the artifact into the target repository using the maven-deploy-plugin
- delete the artifact from the origin repository using the Nexus OSS REST interface

## Build

Build the jar file with 'mvn package' and deploy the war file into a Maven repository, 
either your local one (use mvn install instead of package) or into a repository server using
maven CLI or using a CI Server like Jenkins.

## Usage

A very simple example:

```XML
        <profile>
            <id>promote-artifact</id>
            <build>
                <plugins>
                    <plugin>
                        <groupId>com.github.hcguersoy</groupId>
                        <artifactId>nexus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                        <executions>
                            <execution>
                                <id>moveartifact</id>
                                <phase>validate</phase>
                                <goals>
                                    <goal>move</goal>
                                </goals>
                                <configuration>
                                    <groupId>foo.com</groupId>
                                    <artifactId>foo.project</artifactId>
                                    <version>1.0.0-256-aff45a</version>
                                    <packaging>war</packaging>
                                    <targetNexus>http://foo.com:8080</targetNexus>
                                    <targetRepoID>foo-releases</targetRepoID>
                                    <stagingRepoID>foo-candidates</stagingRepoID>
                                    <stagingNexus>http://foo.com:8080</stagingNexus>
                                </configuration>
                            </execution>
                        </executions>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
```

Activating this profile will do the job during the validate phase in maven.

More to come.

## Next steps

- fix and align dependency versions
- May this should be implemented as a Jenkins plugin
- other repository servers should be supported
- in a far future I plan to publish this @ Maven Central but I hope that this funktionality will get obsolte due to new features in Nexus OSS or other free repsotory servers (hope the guys from Apache Archiva reads this...)
